# Teaching

> Those who can, do; those who can't, teach.
> - a false adage

Teaching and doing are two largely unrelated applications of the same knowledge. This is especially true of computer programming which is a very difficult thing to teach and learn.

## Coaches

## Students

you will do better at HYF if you take the time to help your fellow students with their work than if you just rush ahead on your own. it's too easy to overlook your weak points and become satisfied with just "making it work".  which is a stupid waste of your learning time
- if you can teach, you can be confident of your skills

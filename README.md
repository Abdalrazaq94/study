# Awesome HYF

> Read this [as a GitBook](https://awesome.hackyourfuture.be) or [directly from the SUMMARY](./SUMMARY.md) in the repo.

A giant collection of awesome learning resources to help you succeed at HYF and beyond. The goal of this repository is to be the one tab you can't help but pin.

The modules in our curriculum are organized by level and project, but this repository organized by topic or technology so it can be an easy reference no matter which module introduced a topic.  No need to remember in which week of which module you covered _ChildNode.remove()_, just go to the page about _The DOM_ to review the topic.

## Contributions are Necessary!

To keep this repository book up-to-date and as helpful as possible (for all HYFers) we need _you_ to stay involved!


> If you're reading this on GitBook, there's a button (:octocat: __Edit on GitHub__) in the upper right-hand-corder that will open to the main repo.
>
> From there you can directly send a patch or PR.

* Do you know a great resource we've missed?  Send a Pull Request / Patch with the link!
* Links in all languages are welcome! Just let everyone know what language it is in with a little comment - (tr), (ru), ...
* Are we missing an important topic? Send a PR with a new folder or file (and a link to it in the `SUMMARY.md`, to keep the GitBook up-to-date ;)
* Was a certain link super helpful? Send us a patch with a :green_heart: after the link.  The more hearts the more helpful!
* Was a link not very helpful, or even confusing? Send us a patch with a :broken_heart: after the link. If a link has too many :broken_heart: and not enough :green_heart:, we'll remove it.
* All good things come to an end. If you find a link that has gone dead, send us a Patch with a :coffin: after the link.  We'll wait a couple months then remove it.  Sometimes links come back

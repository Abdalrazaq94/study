## Node.js

The most important thing to understand about Node.js is that it's basically just JavaScript with superpowers - reading & writing to the file system, opening a port on the internet, and working with modules.  The notional machines you've learned for the JS Callstack and Eventloop are still relevant, but with a couple key changes:
* (needs help)
* user events are triggered via a live server instead of the DOM
* access to the computer direclty instad of just the browser (thus file systems, databases, and the like)
* source code can be interpreted and loaded dynamically from any file at any time.  projects can be built in modules with no need for building, bunding and transpiling

Learning a notional machine for Node.js is about building on top of those, not starting from scratch.

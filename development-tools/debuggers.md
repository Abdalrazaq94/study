# Debuggers

These are indispensible!  Without a good debugger (and spending the time to learn how to use it ;) it can be very difficult to learn what your code is _actually_ doing.  Because remember: bugs are when _you_ don't know how your code works, not when _it_ does something you don't want.

## Browser Debuggers

All (reasonable) browsers come with debuggers, and all top browsers come with very good debuggers:

* Good browsers: [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Chromium](https://download-chromium.appspot.com/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) or [Brave](https://brave.com/download/).
* [Getting started](https://javascript.info/debugging-chrome)

It's good to practice with each browser's debugger. And of course to test your websites in all browsers all the time!

## Node Debuggers

Debugging in Node can be a bit trickier than debugging in the browser, simply because there is no DOM to help you visually understand what's happening in your program.

* [Visual Studio Code Debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging)
* Node in Chrome with VSC: [cyrus-and](https://github.com/cyrus-and/chrome-remote-interface), [Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug), [ChromeDevTools](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-frontend)

## Node.js Tutorials

These tutorials will introduce you to a bunch of new features in Node that you haven't seen in the Browser.  While you're following these tutorials, it's important to remember that at it's core Node.js is still JavaScript.  Everything you've learned so far (except for the DOM & `fetch` :) is still true!  The Event Loop, Classes, Closure, Arrays, Objects, Variables, `this.`, it's all still the same.


The tutorials below will introduce to what's new and what's special about Node.  But don't forget to take some time and solve a few of the JavaScript Exercises above to get used to working with plain, vanilla JS in the terminal.

## Open-Source Courses

* [FCC: Responsive Web Design Certificate](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/).  This site is great for mastering the basics of HTML & CSS + design.  The exercises are clear *and* helpful, plus there is a great online community so there are many helpful posts and videos for each exercise. (PS. the [Applied Accessiblity](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-accessibility) exercises are assigned for homework by the end of this module!)
* [The Odin Project: HTML5 & CSS 3](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3). This is another great open source course that will help give some structure to your independent study. TOP is more project-oriented and pulls together resource from all over the internet to help set your study path.
* Both are great options, take a look at each and follow the one that helps you the most!

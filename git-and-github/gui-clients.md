# Graphical User Interface Clients

These are applications that help to  visualize what is happening in your git histories, and generally make git workflows easier than typing words directly into the command line.

Besides doing local git tasks like merging, branching, stashing or committing; most GUIs will also help manage your remote repos to make collaborative development much simpler.

There's no shame in using these, many professional developers rarely use git from the command line! What's important is that you find out what works for you.  As long as you can work easily with others, that's all that counts.
